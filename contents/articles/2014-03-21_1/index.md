After finishing the first MCR supported long run of the season, Jared, Bunda, Gary, Jason and I went to the Triple Rock for brunch. Since it was the first day of registration for the race that has been my obsession for three years, I brought my laptop. Leaving nothing to chance, I ensured my name appeared on the list before passing the laptop clockwise, beginning at 12 o'clock. Four out of the five people at the table would register, with three out of those four doing so to Metallica's Master of Puppets. This does not bode well for the fourth. Rounding out our strange table was a fifth, who prefers to run his 100 milers in April when no one wants to train hard and there's a good chance of snow on the course...oh, and loops. F%####ing loops. Sometimes I wonder if I'm going to be the single person who instigates the jumping of the 100 mile shark.

We drank beer, ate giant plates of potatoes, and reflected on an outstanding long run. Somehow, I've found myself in the best shape of my life in March of 2014. Perhaps it's sub-optimal timing--both with respect to my overall age (why didn't I do this when I was 23?) and the proximity to my *big race*--but one can't be ungrateful for the rare opportunity to bound along like an idiot without any inclination that things could go amiss. I averaged 7:43 min/mile on the 15 mile group portion of the run, bookending it with a warmup and cooldown to push my total just over 20 miles for the day. It was my third twenty miler in eight days, and I ran it at a faster pace than my best marathon, while comfortable chatting with Madeline. There's a good chance I'm doing it all wrong.

So, I'm registered. The obsession that had gone into remission over the winter has violently re-emerged. I immediately began making reservations, planning food, making Facebook event pages, and speculating on possible pacers. Here's the thing--most of the people who came to mind will either be crewing for Bunda or running the race. Back to that momentarily. We decided to once again reserve a 10 person townhome at Caribou Highlands. It provided a good base of operations for Mike, his crew, and a few stragglers (like me!), so we thought we'd try it again. Right now, we're planning on combining our crews into one space, but if we each pick up more than 5 or 6 people, we'll add another unit.

So, pacing. It kind of sounds like running, but that might be debatable. I'll be either 43 or 50 miles into the race when I can pick up the first pacer. For a prospective pacer, this means:

- The majority of our time together will be spent stumbling through the woods, on a rather technical trail, in the middle of the night.
- I'm not going to be moving very fast. I had a *fantastic* race at the 50 miler last year, finishing in 12th place and feeling like I **ran** harder than I've ever run before. That said, my average pace was 14:03 min/mile. I'll be moving much slower at night, after an entire day of running.
- I'll probably get really crabby at some point. Of the 100 mile racers that I passed last year, there were two who were not either completely lobotomized or irritable.
- I'm going to be consistently skeptical about whether we are going the right direction.
- There will be ugliness--it might be gross feet, vomiting, or any number of other unsightly things.

Uhhhm...there are probably a thousand others reasons why pacing me at the Superior 100 will be terrible, but now that I have imaginations stimulated, I'm sure I needn't say anything more. With that disclaimer, I will now ask that you, the reader, consider offering your pacing skillz. Here's a list of things that you might get in return

- Crews all seem to have fun with each other. While crabby runners can be a drag, the people who *aren't* running always seem to be having fun with each other.
- You'll have an excuse to see some pretty amazing parts of the Superior Hiking Trail.
- I'll support you in some silly endeavor that you'd like to undertake, whether it is a 100 mile running race or a Star Trek convention.
- If you kind of don't like me, you'll get to see me really suffering.
- Stars up north can be *really awesome* at night.
- You don't have to get me a birthday present.
