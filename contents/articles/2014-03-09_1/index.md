The prospect of competing in my first hundred mile race later this year has dictated a more concerted effort to acquire base fitness. For the first couple months of the year, that has meant 60 mile weeks. However, last week, the confluence of nice weather, increased involvement with the Mill City racing team, and Jason's preparation for the Zumbro 100 signaled that it was time to put in my first 80+ mile week of the year. Here's how it went down.

- **Monday (10.2 miles)**  
This was just an easy loop down the River Road and backup up the other side via Ford Parkway. After spending the previous Saturday and Sunday in Madison, it was refreshing to get a decent run in. Pace was conservative and temperatures were pleasantly balmy considering the double digit below zero temperatures from the weekend.
- **Tuesday:**  
Rest.
- **Wednesday (12.0 miles)**  
Wednesdays are typically my fast run for the week, and this was no different. The fastest mile was 6:38, two miles in 13:29, and roughly a 7 min/mile pace for the entire loop up to Lowry. I'm starting to feel more comfortable at that pace, and benefited from a few icy spots with my new [Grip Stud enhanced shoes](/#id=/2014/03/07/grip-studs-for-running/). A Grain Belt at the store, combined with a pretty intense food bonk made the last couple miles home difficult.
- **Thursday (6.2 miles):**  
I had originally planned a 10 miler for Thursday, but the hard effort on Wednesday and the proximity of the Wednesday and Friday runs made me cut it short. Nice, relaxed pace with even warmer temperatures.
- **Friday (10.2 miles):**  
Despite running hard on Wednesday, much of this run also ended up being fast. Both my warm up and cool down were quite slow, but the Mill City portion of the run was around 7:15 min/mile. I followed Doron's steady pace on the Broadway loop.
- **Saturday (20.5 miles):**  
Jason, Bunda, and I met the Mill City group for a morning long run on the Cedar Lake trail. I wasn't sure that any of the MCR folks would want to join us on a slower long run, but Jared changed his plan from 5 miles to 20. That's the spirit! Pace was enjoyable and conversation was free-flowing. It was a very nice way to start a Saturday morning. When we reached Cedar Lake we ran the wooded trails, looped around Isles, and then hit the trails again before heading up to Theodore Wirth. After running the first 17 with only one slurp of water from Jason's bottle, it was fantastic to get to the store and eat a banana and chug some water before heading home. I finished feeling strong.
- **Sunday (20.9 miles):**  
I'll admit, I wasn't thrilled with the prospect of back to back twenties, but the allure of running in the woods at Lebanon made the idea too enticing. Plus, I'd bargained with Jared that if he joined me for the Saturday 20, I would join him for his Sunday 20. A good group arrived at the trailhead around 8am, and we began the first of three loops. Trail conditions were fantastic and I felt comfortable with the effort. I left bananas and water in the parking lot, so planned to treat it like an aid station. By the time the third loop rolled around, I was definitely was feeling tired and hungry, but was pleased that nothing was bothering me and I was still able to shuffle along nicely.
