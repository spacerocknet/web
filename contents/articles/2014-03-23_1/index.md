I finished my first 8km in 31:23, or about 6:17 min/mile pace. The horrible photo above reflects the effort that I exerted, which was *substantial*. Having never run a race shorter than a half marathon, I didn't really know what to expect, so I used this strategy--run as hard as possible for as long as possible. Madeline and Ken met me at my house for a warm-up. I felt pretty terrible during this 3.5 mile stretch, struggling to breathe normally even at an 8:30 pace. I considered whether running 15 on Saturday, 12 on Friday, and 10 on Thursday might not have been the best taper. I shrugged it off and moved to the starting line.

I chatted with a group of Mill City Running teammates, and determined that I would run with a few other people who were targeting 34 minutes. As soon as the pack started moving forward, I called an audible--leave it all out there. I quickly started passing people, watching my average pace drop into the six minute per mile range. By the time we hit the turnaround at one kilometer, I was feeling pretty lively. I reached the 1 mile mark in 6m13s, thinking, "Hmm, maybe that's a little bit too hard." It was, after all, my new mile PR. I suddenly thought about gym class, struggling to run a mile in under ten minutes (a feat I only accomplished once). I passed a lot of people going up the slight incline on Summit. I started thinking about the next turnaround. "Just get to the turnaround and it's all downhill".

Except, that wasn't the case. The turnaround only turned me back into the wind, and if we were running downhill, I couldn't tell. I stopped passing people and settled in with a small group. By mile four, I felt like I was just doing damage control. I was only running a couple seconds per mile slower, but I knew that I was a ticking time bomb. The legs *would* stop turning over. Fortunately, I measured it pretty well and coasted in to the finish without losing much, if any, time in the last two miles. A new five mile PR, five new one mile PRs, and a sheepish admission that it's actually kind of fun to run short races.
