I must confess this an unoriginal idea. One of my favorite bloggers [did a thing](http://laelsglobe.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/yikes-spikes/), I marveled, and then eventually proceeded to do the same thing. The severe cold and abundance of snow this winter has made ice an infrequent concern, so when I first read Lael's post, I admired her ingenuity, but did nothing more than catalog the information with other neat-but-useless tricks that occupy my mind. However, the sloppy freeze-thaw cycle has arrived for the spring, leaving me feeling like a stranded animal in one of those well documented hovercraft assisted deer rescues. Consequently, I started looking for Grip Studs.

Locating the studs and installation tool were a bit trickier than I'd imagined it would be. I know only a little bit about the company, but it goes something like this--they've primarily made studs for *big things*, only recently dabbling in the world of human propulsion. Their bicycle tire studs are sold in packages of 100 for $100, with the installation tool costing another $10. I neither wanted to put 100 studs in my shoes or spend $110, so I posted on local bicycling forums.  After an array of creative alternatives were proposed, Karl from Freewheel offered to split open a pack and let me use their tool. Perfect.

I stopped in at Freewheel, sat down on a couch, and went to work. The ingenious design found me easily twisting the studs into the soles of a cheap pair of Asics Gel Lyte 33 2s. They have a very soft forefoot, which I figured might help them wear longer. Fifteen minutes later, I was done.

I was amazed to find that, aside from noisy footfall, the studs were not at all noticeable on the occasional paved section. On ice, they did what they do for bicycle tires--just enough to keep you from falling. It wasn't like running with crampons, but with a modicum of care and attention, I could easily maneuver quickly through icy sections. The compromise felt brilliant.

Once I arrived at the group run, I had the opportunity to really put them to the test. On the snowy and icy sections, we were clipping along around 7:00 min/mile. Once we reached the section of pavement from Broadway to Lowry, our pace dropped to around 6:30 min/mile. I was pleased that any wheezing I was doing was from my lack of fitness, and not from extra pieces of metal in my shoes. Doing the same pace in Yaktrax would be not only uncomfortable for me, but impossible. When we reached the icy bridge, I had a distinct advantage. I did not have to shorten my stride while the other, faster runners did. It was fun.

Durability is a mystery, as I've only been using them for a few days, but in all other regards, I give them a resounding thumbs up.
